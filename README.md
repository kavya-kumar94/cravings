## Technologies and Challenges 
Cravings utilizes the MERN stack which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. 

React-ChartJS was used to create a pie chart that shows interactivity with the user's input. The biggest challenge for implementation was figuring out how to get data from chart to set the state in the frontend and fetching relevant information from the mongoDB database in the backend.

The Yelp API was used to seed the mongoDB database with restaurant locations relevant to the user's location. 

Challenges during this project include using query strings to fetch the user's input from the ChartJS data and introducing dynamic results to the user by filtering the query in a more flexible way.
